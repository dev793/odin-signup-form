# odin-signup-form

A project to practice form creation, focused on HTML and CSS. First project in this course, and first project since the end of last year.

Goal is to create a signup form that looks like the sign-up-form.png file.

# Reflection

Ended up being a straightforward project, building the form wasn't particularly challenging. It took longer than I would have liked, because I like to get as close to example design as possible, and so end up spending a lot of time guessing font sizes, measurements, etc. I don't think my CSS would be considered "best practice", but the brief explicitly stated to not worry about making the design responsive, so I ended up with some questionable CSS to try and get as close to the example layout as possible.

I can definitely see there being an art and a science to building responsive and well structured webpages, but I get the feeling there are so many different approaches one could take, which feels daunting.
